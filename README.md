Technologies used:

ReactJS, state hook, spread operators, axios,
Amazon AWS EC2 Windows, Load Balancer,
Swagger,
Entity Framework,
SQL Server Management Studio,
Powershell (to run npm commands and dotnet commands)

Tried and Failed:

Used Docker SQL image and connected from Azure Data Studio in Mac (as I primarily work on mac) and imported the data. 
Couldn't run donet commands such as scaffold-database on mac M1 chip (ran into ARM Architecuture issues).
So as a resort, switched to developing on EC2 Windows instance.
